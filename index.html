                <li>
                    After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in
                    Poole,
                    Dorset. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting
                    software for printers.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva,
                    he
                    proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information
                    among researchers. To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.
                </li>

                <li>
                    After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in
                    Bournemouth, Dorset. He ran the company's technical side for three years. The project he worked
                    on was a "real-time remote procedure call" which gave him experience in computer networking. In
                    1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.
                </li>

                <li>
                    In 1989, CERN was the largest Internet node in Europe and Berners-Lee saw an opportunity to join
                    hypertext with the Internet:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I just had to take the hypertext idea and connect it to the TCP and DNS ideas and—ta-da!—the
                            World Wide Web. — Tim Berners-Lee
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Creating the web was really an act of desperation, because the situation without it was very
                            difficult when I was working at CERN later. Most of the technology involved in the web, like
                            the
                            hypertext, like the Internet, multifont text objects, had all been designed already. I just
                            had
                            to put them together. It was a step of generalising, going to a higher level of abstraction,
                            thinking about all the documentation systems out there as being possibly part of a larger
                            imaginary documentation system. — Tim Berners-Lee
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Berners-Lee wrote his proposal in March 1989 and, in 1990, redistributed it. It then was accepted by
                    his
                    manager, Mike Sendall, who called his proposals "vague, but exciting". Robert Cailliau had
                    independently proposed a project to develop a hypertext system at CERN, and joined Berners-Lee as a
                    partner in his efforts to get the web off the ground.[30] They used similar ideas to those
                    underlying
                    the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which Berners-Lee designed and built the first
                    web
                    browser. His software also functioned as an editor (called WorldWideWeb, running on the NeXTSTEP
                    operating system), and the first Web server, CERN HTTPd (short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol
                    daemon).
                </li>

                <li>
                    Berners-Lee published the first web site, which described the project itself, on 20 December 1990;
                    it
                    was available to the Internet from the CERN network. The site provided an explanation of what the
                    World
                    Wide Web was, and how people could use a browser and set up a web server, as well as how to get
                    started
                    with your own website. On 6 August 1991, Berners-Lee first posted, on Usenet, a
                    public invitation for collaboration with the WorldWideWeb project.

                    In a list of 80 cultural moments that shaped the world, chosen by a panel of 25 eminent scientists,
                    academics, writers and world leaders, the invention of the World Wide Web was ranked number one,
                    with
                    the entry stating, "The fastest growing communications medium of all time, the Internet has changed
                    the
                    shape of modern life forever. We can connect with each other instantly, all over the world."

                <li>
                    In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It comprised
                    various
                    companies that were willing to create standards and recommendations to improve the quality of the
                    Web.
                    Berners-Lee made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The World Wide Web
                    Consortium decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so that they
                    easily
                    could be adopted by anyone.

                <li>
                    Berners-Lee participated in Curl Corp's attempt to develop and promote the Curl programming
                    language.
                </li>

                <li>
                    In 2001, Berners-Lee became a patron of the East Dorset Heritage Trust, having previously lived in
                    Colehill in Wimborne, East Dorset. In December 2004, he accepted a chair in computer science at the
                    School of Electronics and Computer Science, University of Southampton, Hampshire, to work on the
                    Semantic Web.

                <li>
                    In a Times article in October 2009, Berners-Lee admitted that the initial pair of slashes ("//") in
                    a
                    web address were "unnecessary". He told the newspaper that he easily could have designed web
                    addresses
                    without the slashes. "There you go, it seemed like a good idea at the time," he said in his
                    lighthearted
                    apology.

            <p class="policy">
                In June 2009, then-British prime minister Gordon Brown announced that Berners-Lee would work with the UK
                government to help make data more open and accessible on the Web, building on the work of the Power of
                Information Task Force. Berners-Lee and Professor Nigel Shadbolt are the two key figures behind
                data.gov.uk, a UK government project to open up almost all data acquired for official purposes for free
                reuse. Commenting on the opening up of Ordnance Survey data in April 2010, Berners-Lee said: "The
                changes
                signal a wider cultural change in government based on an assumption that information should be in the
                public
                domain unless there is a good reason not to—not the other way around." He went on to say: "Greater
                openness,
                accountability and transparency in Government will give people greater choice and make it easier for
                individuals to get more directly involved in issues that matter to them."
